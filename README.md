Writing music audio files using the *wave* module in Python  

----
The *wave* module in the Python standard library provides a convenient interface to the WAV sound format.

We intend to write some music with this module.  
The *playsound* module can be used to play the WAV file generated. Run the following command to install it:

  pip install playsound

The *simplest.py* script in the *examples* folder demonstrates creation of simple monophonic melodies with sine waves and square waves. The song is "Ting Wo Shuo Xie Xie Ni". We would like add more features to the program to produce chords and more complicated melodies in the future.
